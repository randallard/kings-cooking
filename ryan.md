Left off at 

  The PRP foundation is complete and ready for you to review or for me to continue building out the remaining sections (WHAT, REFERENCE DOCUMENTATION, IMPLEMENTATION BLUEPRINT, VALIDATION LOOP, etc.).

  Would you like me to continue completing the PRP document, or would you prefer to review what's been created so far?
