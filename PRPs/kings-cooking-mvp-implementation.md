name: "King's Cooking Chess Variant MVP - Phase 1 Implementation"
description: |
  Complete implementation of King's Cooking chess variant MVP with Astro 5+ Islands Architecture,
  WebRTC peer-to-peer multiplayer, and comprehensive TDD approach.

---

## Goal

**Feature Goal**: Implement a fully functional King's Cooking chess variant MVP that allows two players to connect via WebRTC, play the custom chess variant with variable board sizes and party victory conditions, and deploy to GitHub Pages.

**Deliverable**: Working chess game deployed to GitHub Pages with:
- Astro 5+ static site with Islands Architecture
- WebRTC peer-to-peer multiplayer (no server required)
- Custom chess variant rules implementation
- Variable board sizes (4x4 to 12x12)
- Three setup modes (Random, Mirrored, Independent)
- Party victory condition (captured pieces join opponent's king)
- Off-board moves for rooks and queens
- Mobile-responsive design
- 80%+ test coverage

**Success Definition**: Two players can successfully connect via shared link, complete game setup, play a full game following King's Cooking rules, and declare a winner based on party guest count.

## User Persona

**Target User**: Social chess enthusiasts aged 18-50 who enjoy innovative game variants

**Use Case**: Friends wanting to play a unique chess variant remotely without account creation or server setup

**User Journey**:
1. Player 1 visits the site and clicks "Create Game"
2. Player 1 selects board size (default 8x6)
3. Player 1 shares generated game link with Player 2
4. Player 2 clicks link and chooses setup mode
5. Players complete piece selection based on chosen mode
6. Players take turns making moves following chess rules
7. Captured pieces join the capturing player's king for a party
8. Rooks/queens can move off-board to join their own king's party
9. King with most party guests wins and hosts the celebration

**Pain Points Addressed**:
- No account creation required
- No server maintenance or costs
- Unique variant keeps chess interesting
- Quick setup and play

## Why

- **Unique Value Proposition**: Only peer-to-peer chess variant with party-themed victory condition
- **Zero Infrastructure Cost**: Static hosting with P2P networking eliminates ongoing costs
- **Social Innovation**: Transforms competitive chess into collaborative party planning
- **Technical Innovation**: Demonstrates modern web capabilities (WebRTC + Islands Architecture)
- **Market Gap**: No existing chess variants combine custom boards, P2P networking, and party themes

## What

### Core Game Features
- **Variable Board Sizes**: 4x4 to 12x12 boards with responsive UI
- **Three Setup Modes**:
  - Random: Weighted random piece selection with customizable pawn ratio
  - Mirrored: Turn-based piece selection with mirrored placement
  - Independent: Players see opponent choices but select independently
- **Party Victory Condition**: King with most captured opponent pieces wins
- **Off-Board Moves**: Rooks and queens can move directly to their king's party
- **Standard Chess Rules**: All normal movement rules plus en passant
- **Real-Time Sync**: Instant move synchronization via WebRTC DataChannels

### Technical Features
- **WebRTC P2P**: Direct browser-to-browser communication
- **Static Deployment**: GitHub Pages hosting with zero server costs
- **Mobile-First**: Touch-friendly interface with drag-and-drop
- **Offline Capability**: Local game state persistence
- **Connection Recovery**: Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Two players can connect via shared link with >95% success rate
- [ ] All King's Cooking rules work correctly (verified by automated tests)
- [ ] Game completes in <30 seconds from link click to first move
- [ ] Mobile users can play comfortably on phones and tablets

```bash
# Production build and preview
pnpm build
pnpm preview

# Bundle analysis
du -sh dist/
find dist -name "*.js" -exec ls -lh {} \; | sort -k5 -hr
```

### Level 6: Performance & Compatibility
```bash
# Lighthouse performance audit
npx lighthouse http://localhost:4321 --output=json

# Cross-browser compatibility verification
# (Run E2E tests on multiple browsers via Playwright)
npx playwright test --project=chromium --project=firefox --project=webkit
```

## Final Validation Checklist

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Two players can connect via shared link
- [ ] All three setup modes work correctly (Random, Mirrored, Independent)
- [ ] Variable board sizes (4x4 to 12x12) render and function properly
- [ ] Standard chess moves work on custom board sizes
- [ ] Off-board moves work for rooks and queens only
- [ ] Captured pieces correctly join opponent's king party
- [ ] Victory condition calculates correctly (most party guests wins)
- [ ] Game state synchronizes in real-time between players
- [ ] Connection recovery works after temporary disconnections

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] 80%+ test coverage across unit, integration, and E2E tests

- [ ] Lighthouse performance score >90

### User Experience Requirements
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design works on phones and tablets
- [ ] Touch interactions work smoothly (drag-and-drop, tap-to-select)
- [ ] Loading states provide clear feedback
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly and actionable
- [ ] Game rules are clearly explained
- [ ] Victory celebrations are engaging and clear

### Browser Compatibility
- [ ] Chrome (latest 2 versions)
- [ ] Firefox (latest 2 versions)
- [ ] Safari (latest 2 versions)
- [ ] Edge (latest 2 versions)
- [ ] Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)

### Security & Performance
- [ ] No sensitive data exposed in client code
- [ ] WebRTC connections use secure protocols
- [ ] Input validation prevents malformed game states
- [ ] Memory usage stays reasonable during long games
- [ ] No significant memory leaks detected

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **WebRTC Connection Reliability**: Implement comprehensive TURN fallback and retry logic
2. **Chess Engine Complexity**: Start with thorough unit tests before building UI
3. **State Synchronization**: Use deterministic conflict resolution with timestamps
4. **Mobile Performance**: Optimize bundle size and use efficient rendering

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Parallel Development**: Build chess engine and WebRTC layer simultaneously
2. **Incremental Testing**: Test each component thoroughly before integration
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with basic functionality, add features incrementally
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Use bundle analysis and Lighthouse throughout development

## Success Confidence Score: 9/10

This PRP provides comprehensive context for one-pass implementation success. The detailed research findings, exact file patterns, proven library configurations, and comprehensive testing strategy should enable successful implementation by an AI agent with minimal additional context needed.
