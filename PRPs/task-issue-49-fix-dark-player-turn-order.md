# Task PRP: Fix Turn Order and Handoff Message When Player 1 Chooses Dark

**Issue**: #49
**Type**: Bug Fix
**Complexity**: Medium
**Framework**: React 19 + TypeScript + Zod
**TDD Approach**: Red → Green → Refactor

---

## Goal

Fix the turn order display when Player 1 chooses to play as dark color. Two critical bugs:
1. **Turn display bug**: Shows "Current turn: Ryan" when Player 1 (Ryan) chose dark, but Ted (Player 2/light) should go first
2. **Handoff message bug**: Shows "Dark(Ryan) made their move" when it should show "Light(Ted) gets the first move"

---

## Why

**Business Value:**
- Prevents player confusion about whose turn it is
- Ensures correct understanding of game flow in both hot-seat and URL modes
- Maintains consistency with game rules (light always moves first)

**User Impact:**
- Players currently see misleading message suggesting Dark player already moved
- Breaks immersion and game understanding
- Critical severity - affects core game flow

---

## What (User-Visible Behavior)

### Current Broken Behavior
When Player 1 (Ryan) selects dark color during setup:
1. After piece selection → Handoff screen passes device to Player 2 (Ted)
2. **BUG #1**: Turn display shows "Current turn: Ryan" even though Ted (light) should go first
3. **BUG #2**: Handoff screen shows "Dark's Turn" as title (should be Light)
4. **BUG #3**: Handoff screen shows "Dark (Ryan) made their move" when NO move was made yet

### Expected Correct Behavior
When Player 1 (Ryan) selects dark color during setup:
1. After piece selection → Handoff screen passes device to Player 2 (Ted)
2. **FIX #1**: Turn display shows "Current turn: Ted" (light player goes first)
3. **FIX #2**: Handoff screen shows "Light's Turn" or "Ted's Turn" as title
4. **FIX #3**: Handoff screen shows "Light(Ted) gets the first move"
5. Light player (Ted) makes the first move, game proceeds correctly

### Affects Both Modes
- ✅ Hot-seat mode: Pass device from Player 1 (dark) to Player 2 (light)
- ✅ URL mode: Player 1 generates URL, sends to Player 2 who makes first move

---

## All Needed Context

### Architecture Overview

**State Machine Flow**:
```
ColorSelectionScreen (Player 1 chooses light/dark)
  ↓ SET_PLAYER_COLOR action
PieceSelectionPhase (player1Color stored in state)
  ↓ COMPLETE_PIECE_SELECTION action
HandoffPhase (if player1Color === 'dark', handoff to light player)
  ↓ COMPLETE_HANDOFF action
PlayingPhase (game begins, currentPlayer = 'light')
```

### Key Files

| File | Purpose | Lines |
|------|---------|-------|
| `src/lib/gameFlow/reducer.ts` | State machine reducer | 371-446 (COMPLETE_PIECE_SELECTION) |
| `src/components/game/HandoffScreen.tsx` | Displays handoff message | 109-131 (message logic) |
| `src/App.tsx` | Renders HandoffScreen with props | 890-910 (normal handoff), 840-850 (first handoff) |
| `src/types/gameFlow.ts` | Type definitions | 120-144 (HandoffPhase) |

### Current HandoffScreen Props

```typescript
interface HandoffScreenProps {
  nextPlayer: 'light' | 'dark';       // Which player's turn is next
  nextPlayerName: string;              // Name of next player
  previousPlayer: 'light' | 'dark';   // Color of player who just moved
  previousPlayerName: string;          // Name of player who just moved
  onContinue: () => void;
  countdownSeconds?: number;
}
```

**Current message generation** (HandoffScreen.tsx:109-131):
```typescript
const nextPlayerColor = nextPlayer === 'light' ? 'Light' : 'Dark';
const previousPlayerColor = previousPlayer === 'light' ? 'Light' : 'Dark';

<h2>{nextPlayerColor}'s Turn</h2>
<p>
  {previousPlayerColor} ({previousPlayerName}) made their move.
  <br />
  Pass the device to {nextPlayerName}.
</p>
```

**Problem**: Always says "{previousColor} ({previousName}) made their move" even when NO move has been made (game start).

### How to Detect Game Start

From `HandoffPhase.gameState`:
- `gameState.currentTurn === 0` → No turns taken yet
- `gameState.moveHistory.length === 0` → No moves recorded
- This happens after COMPLETE_PIECE_SELECTION when player1Color === 'dark'

### Reducer Logic Reference

**COMPLETE_PIECE_SELECTION** (reducer.ts:371-446):
```typescript
// Creates game state with correct player assignment
const lightPlayer = {
  name: state.player1Color === 'light' ? state.player1Name : state.player2Name || 'Player 2',
};
const darkPlayer = {
  name: state.player1Color === 'light' ? state.player2Name || 'Player 2' : state.player1Name,
};

// If Player 1 chose dark, transition to handoff before game starts
if (state.player1Color === 'dark') {
  return {
    phase: 'handoff',
    gameState,  // currentTurn = 0, moveHistory = []
    player1Color: state.player1Color,
    // ... other fields
  };
}
```

### Testing Patterns

**Reducer Tests** (reducer.test.ts):
```typescript
it('should handle action correctly', () => {
  const initialState = { /* ... */ };
  const action = { type: 'ACTION_TYPE', /* ... */ };
  const result = gameFlowReducer(initialState, action);

  expect(result).toMatchObject({
    phase: 'expected-phase',
    // ... expected fields
  });
});
```

**Component Tests** (HandoffScreen.test.tsx:20-62):
```typescript
it('should display correct message', () => {
  render(
    <HandoffScreen
      nextPlayer="light"
      nextPlayerName="Alice"
      previousPlayer="dark"
      previousPlayerName="Bob"
      onContinue={vi.fn()}
    />
  );

  expect(screen.getByText(/light \(bob\) made their move/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

### Documentation

- **CLAUDE.md**: Lines 1-815 - Follow TDD, 80% coverage, conventional commits
- **Game Rules** (PRD.md): Light always moves first regardless of player names
- **State Machine** (types/gameFlow.ts): Discriminated union pattern for phases

---

## Implementation Blueprint

### TDD Approach: Red → Green → Refactor

**Phase 1 - RED (Write Failing Tests)**
1. Write reducer test for handoff phase when player1Color === 'dark'
2. Write HandoffScreen component test for game-start scenario
3. Run tests → Should fail ❌

**Phase 2 - GREEN (Minimal Fix)**
1. Add `isGameStart` prop to HandoffScreen
2. Update HandoffScreen to show different message when isGameStart
3. Update App.tsx to pass isGameStart based on gameState.currentTurn
4. Run tests → Should pass ✅

**Phase 3 - REFACTOR (Clean Up)**
1. Extract message generation to helper function
2. Ensure type safety with Zod if needed
3. Add accessibility improvements
4. Run tests → Should still pass ✅

### Detailed Task Breakdown

#### TASK 1: CREATE failing test for turn display with player1Color

**File**: `src/App.test.tsx`

**Action**: ADD new test case for turn display when Player 1 chooses dark

```typescript
describe('Turn display with player color selection', () => {
  it('should display correct player name when Player 1 chose dark', () => {
    // Setup: Player 1 (Alice) chose dark, Player 2 (Bob) is light
    const mockGameState = createMockGameState({
      currentPlayer: 'light',  // Light goes first
      lightPlayer: { id: uuid(), name: 'Bob' },   // Player 2
      darkPlayer: { id: uuid(), name: 'Alice' },  // Player 1
    });

    const playingState: PlayingPhase = {
      phase: 'playing',
      mode: 'hotseat',
      player1Name: 'Alice',
      player2Name: 'Bob',
      gameState: mockGameState,
      selectedPosition: null,
      legalMoves: [],
      pendingMove: null,
    };

    render(<App initialState={playingState} />);

    // Should show Bob's turn (light player), NOT Alice
    expect(screen.getByText(/current turn:/i)).toHaveTextContent('Bob');
    expect(screen.getByText(/current turn:/i)).not.toHaveTextContent('Alice');
  });
});
```

**Validation**:
```bash
pnpm test App.test.tsx
# Should see: ❌ Test fails - shows "Alice" instead of "Bob"
```

---

#### TASK 2: UPDATE App.tsx turn display to use gameState player names

**File**: `src/App.tsx`

**Action**: UPDATE turn display logic (lines 746-751)

**Current broken code**:
```typescript
<strong>Current Turn:</strong>{' '}
{state.gameState.currentPlayer === 'light' ? (
  state.player1Name || 'Light'
) : (
  state.player2Name || 'Dark'
)}
```

**Fixed code**:
```typescript
<strong>Current Turn:</strong>{' '}
{state.gameState.currentPlayer === 'light'
  ? state.gameState.lightPlayer.name
  : state.gameState.darkPlayer.name}
```

**Why this fixes it:**
- Uses `gameState.lightPlayer.name` / `darkPlayer.name` directly
- These names are ALREADY correctly assigned based on player1Color in the reducer
- No need to map player numbers - the gameState knows who is light/dark

**Validation**:
```bash
pnpm run check
pnpm test App.test.tsx
# Should see: ✅ TypeScript passes, test now passes
```

---

#### TASK 3: CREATE failing test for HandoffScreen game-start message

**File**: `src/components/game/HandoffScreen.test.tsx`

**Action**: ADD new test case in existing describe block

```typescript
describe('Handoff message display', () => {
  it('should display game-start message when no moves made yet', () => {
    render(
      <HandoffScreen
        nextPlayer="light"
        nextPlayerName="Ted"
        previousPlayer="dark"
        previousPlayerName="Ryan"
        isGameStart={true}  // NEW PROP
        onContinue={vi.fn()}
      />
    );

    // Should NOT show "made their move"
    expect(screen.queryByText(/made their move/i)).not.toBeInTheDocument();

    // SHOULD show "gets the first move"
    expect(screen.getByText(/light \(ted\) gets the first move/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('should display normal handoff message mid-game', () => {
    render(
      <HandoffScreen
        nextPlayer="dark"
        nextPlayerName="Ryan"
        previousPlayer="light"
        previousPlayerName="Ted"
        isGameStart={false}  // Mid-game
        onContinue={vi.fn()}
      />
    );

    // Should show normal "made their move" message
    expect(screen.getByText(/light \(ted\) made their move/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

**Validation**:
```bash
pnpm test HandoffScreen.test.tsx
# Should see: ❌ Test fails - isGameStart prop doesn't exist
```

---

#### TASK 4: UPDATE HandoffScreen props interface to include isGameStart

**File**: `src/components/game/HandoffScreen.tsx`

**Action**: UPDATE Props interface (around line 15)

```typescript
interface HandoffScreenProps {
  nextPlayer: 'light' | 'dark';
  nextPlayerName: string;
  previousPlayer: 'light' | 'dark';
  previousPlayerName: string;
  onContinue: () => void;
  countdownSeconds?: number;
  isGameStart?: boolean;  // ADD THIS - true when game just started (no moves yet)
}
```

**Validation**:
```bash
pnpm run check
# Should pass - type added correctly
```

---

#### TASK 5: UPDATE HandoffScreen message generation logic

**File**: `src/components/game/HandoffScreen.tsx`

**Action**: UPDATE message display logic (lines 109-131)

```typescript
const nextPlayerColor = nextPlayer === 'light' ? 'Light' : 'Dark';
const previousPlayerColor = previousPlayer === 'light' ? 'Light' : 'Dark';

// NEW: Determine message based on game state
const message = isGameStart
  ? `${nextPlayerColor} (${nextPlayerName}) gets the first move.`
  : `${previousPlayerColor} (${previousPlayerName}) made their move.`;

<h2 id="handoff-title" className={styles.title}>
  {nextPlayerColor}'s Turn
</h2>

<p id="handoff-description" className={styles.description}>
  {message}
  <br />
  {!isGameStart && `Pass the device to ${nextPlayerName}.`}
  {isGameStart && `Ready to start!`}
</p>
```

**Validation**:
```bash
pnpm test HandoffScreen.test.tsx
# Should see: ✅ Tests pass with new logic
```

---

#### TASK 6: UPDATE App.tsx to pass isGameStart prop

**File**: `src/App.tsx`

**Action**: UPDATE HandoffScreen rendering logic (two locations)

**Location 1** - First handoff after piece selection (lines 840-850):
```typescript
// When collecting Player 2 name after piece selection
<HandoffScreen
  nextPlayer={state.gameState.currentPlayer}
  nextPlayerName="Player 2"
  previousPlayer={state.gameState.currentPlayer === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'}
  previousPlayerName={state.player1Name || 'Light'}
  isGameStart={state.gameState.currentTurn === 0}  // ADD THIS
  onContinue={() => {
    setHandoffStepCompleted(true);
  }}
  countdownSeconds={3}
/>
```

**Location 2** - Normal handoff during gameplay (lines 890-910):
```typescript
const isGameStart = state.gameState.currentTurn === 0 && state.gameState.moveHistory.length === 0;

<HandoffScreen
  nextPlayer={state.gameState.currentPlayer}
  nextPlayerName={nextPlayerName}
  previousPlayer={previousPlayer}
  previousPlayerName={previousPlayerName}
  isGameStart={isGameStart}  // ADD THIS
  onContinue={() => {
    dispatch({ type: 'COMPLETE_HANDOFF' });
  }}
  countdownSeconds={3}
/>
```

**Validation**:
```bash
pnpm run check && pnpm run lint
# Should pass - no TypeScript or lint errors
```

---

#### TASK 7: CREATE reducer test for handoff phase with player1Color='dark'

**File**: `src/lib/gameFlow/reducer.test.ts`

**Action**: ADD test in COMPLETE_PIECE_SELECTION describe block

```typescript
describe('COMPLETE_PIECE_SELECTION with player1Color="dark"', () => {
  it('should transition to handoff phase when Player 1 chose dark', () => {
    const pieceSelectionState: PieceSelectionPhase = {
      phase: 'piece-selection',
      mode: 'hotseat',
      player1Name: 'Ryan',
      player2Name: 'Ted',
      selectionMode: 'random',
      player1Pieces: ['rook', 'knight', 'bishop'],
      player2Pieces: ['rook', 'knight', 'bishop'],
      player1Color: 'dark',  // KEY: Player 1 chose dark
    };

    const action: GameFlowAction = {
      type: 'COMPLETE_PIECE_SELECTION',
      firstMover: 'light', // Light goes first (always)
    };

    const result = gameFlowReducer(pieceSelectionState, action);

    // Should transition to handoff phase, not directly to playing
    expect(result.phase).toBe('handoff');
    expect(result.mode).toBe('hotseat');

    // Verify game state created correctly
    if (result.phase === 'handoff' && result.gameState) {
      expect(result.gameState.currentPlayer).toBe('light'); // Light goes first
      expect(result.gameState.currentTurn).toBe(0); // No moves yet
      expect(result.gameState.lightPlayer.name).toBe('Ted'); // Player 2 is light
      expect(result.gameState.darkPlayer.name).toBe('Ryan'); // Player 1 is dark
    }
  });
});
```

**Validation**:
```bash
pnpm test reducer.test.ts
# Should pass - logic already exists, we're adding regression test
```

#### TASK 9: MANUAL verification with dev server

**Steps**:
1. Start dev server: `pnpm dev`
2. Open http://localhost:5173
3. **Test Scenario 1**: Player 1 chooses DARK
   - Select hot-seat mode
   - Enter Player 1 name: "Ryan"
   - Choose "Dark 🌙" color
   - Select random pieces → Click "Start Game"
   - **VERIFY**: Handoff screen shows "Light (Player 2) gets the first move"
   - **VERIFY**: Does NOT show "made their move"

4. **Test Scenario 2**: Player 1 chooses LIGHT
   - Start new game
   - Enter Player 1 name: "Ryan"
   - Choose "Light ☀️" color
   - Select random pieces → Click "Start Game"
   - **VERIFY**: Game starts immediately (no handoff)
   - Make first move
   - **VERIFY**: After move, handoff shows "Light (Ryan) made their move"

5. **Test Scenario 3**: URL Mode with Player 1 dark
   - Select URL mode
   - Enter Player 1 name
   - Choose "Dark" color
   - Select pieces, click "Start Game"
   - **VERIFY**: Handoff screen shows correct "gets first move" message
   - Copy URL, open in new tab
   - **VERIFY**: Player 2 can make first move

**Validation**: All scenarios work correctly ✅

---

## Rollback Strategy

If issues arise:
```bash
git checkout main
git branch -D issue-49-fix-dark-player-turn-order
```

Changes are isolated to:
- HandoffScreen.tsx (message logic)
- App.tsx (prop passing)
- Test files (new tests)

No database migrations, no API changes, minimal risk.

---

## Additional Context

### Related Issues
- Issue #4: Refactor black/white → light/dark (completed, related terminology)
- Issue #6: Piece selection (completed, affects this flow)

### Game Rules Reference (PRD.md)
- Light player ALWAYS moves first
- Dark player ALWAYS moves second
- Player 1 choosing color doesn't change this rule

### TypeScript Strict Mode
- All changes must maintain strict type safety
- Use discriminated unions for state machine
- Validate props with interfaces
