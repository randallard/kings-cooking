# State Diagram Template

This template provides the standard structure for documenting game states in the Correspondence Games Framework.

## Overview

Every correspondence game should use a **unified flow** with **mode-specific UI differences**.

**Key Principle:** Hot-Seat and URL modes share the same state flow, but display different UI elements in certain states.

**Why Unified Flow?**
- ‚úÖ Simpler architecture - one flow to maintain
- ‚úÖ Shared code between modes
- ‚úÖ Easier to understand and debug
- ‚úÖ Consistent player experience
- ‚úÖ Mode differences are just UI, not logic

---

## Document Structure

Your `STATE_DIAGRAMS.md` file should have this structure:

## State Details

### State: Player1Name

**Condition**: `player1Name === null` (app first loads)

**Purpose**: Collect player 1's name

**Display**:
- Header: "[Game Title]"
- Form label: "Enter your name:"
- Input field (pre-filled from `localStorage['my-name']` if exists)
- Button: "Continue"

**Both Modes**: Same UI (no mode chosen yet)

**Transitions**:
- Submit form ‚Üí Save name to `localStorage['my-name']`, go to `ModeSelection`

**Implementation Notes**:
- Input should be `autoFocus`, `required`, `maxLength={20}`

## State Variables Reference

### React State

```typescript
// Player identity
player1Name: string | null          // React state for UI
player2Name: string | null          // React state for UI (hot-seat) or null (URL)
myPlayerNumber: 1 | 2 | null       // URL mode: which player am I
myPlayerId: string                  // URL mode: persistent UUID

// Game state
gameMode: 'hotseat' | 'url' | null
gameState: GameState | null
selectedCell: number | null         // Move selection state
shareUrl: string                    // URL mode: generated share link
```

### Game State (Persisted)

```typescript
{
  gameId: string                    // UUID
  // Game-specific fields (board, pieces, etc.)
  currentTurn: number               // Increments each move
  currentPlayer: 1 | 2              // Whose turn
  player1: { id: string, name: string }
  player2: { id: string, name: string }
  status: 'playing' | 'player1_wins' | 'player2_wins' | 'draw'
  checksum: string                  // For validation
}
```

### localStorage Keys

**Both Modes:**
- `correspondence-games:my-name` - Current player's name
- `correspondence-games:my-player-id` - Persistent UUID
- `[game-name]:game-state` - Serialized game state

**Hot-Seat Mode Only:**
- `correspondence-games:player1-name` - Player 1's specific name
- `correspondence-games:player2-name` - Player 2's specific name

---

## Critical Implementation Patterns

### Move Selection & Confirmation

```typescript
const [selectedCell, setSelectedCell] = useState<number | null>(null);

const handleCellClick = (index: number) => {
  // Can't select if not my turn
  if (gameState.currentPlayer !== myPlayerNumber) return;

  // Toggle selection
  if (selectedCell === index) {
    setSelectedCell(null); // Deselect
  } else {
    setSelectedCell(index); // Select or change
  }
};

const handleConfirm = async () => {
  if (selectedCell === null) return;

  // Apply move to game state
  const newGameState = applyMove(gameState, selectedCell);

  // Generate URL only in URL mode, only after confirmation
  if (gameMode === 'url') {
    const url = await generateURL(newGameState);
    setShareUrl(url);
  }

  // Clear selection and update game
  setSelectedCell(null);
  setGameState(newGameState);
  // Transition to handoff
};
```

### P2 Name Collection Timing

```typescript
// Check on handoff
if (player2Name === null && gameState.currentTurn === 1) {
  // Show Player2NamePrompt
  return <Player2NameForm />;
}
```

### Mode-Specific UI

```typescript
// Confirm button text
const confirmText = gameMode === 'hotseat'
  ? 'Confirm & Hand Off'
  : 'Confirm & Generate URL';

// Handoff UI
if (gameMode === 'hotseat') {
  return <PassDeviceScreen />;
} else {
  return <ShareURLScreen url={shareUrl} />;
}
```

---

## Common Pitfalls

### ‚ùå Generating URL Too Early

**Wrong:**
```typescript
// URL generates on cell click
const handleCellClick = (index: number) => {
  setSelectedCell(index);
  const url = generateURL(gameState); // TOO EARLY!
  setShareUrl(url);
};
```

**Correct:**
```typescript
// URL generates only on confirm
const handleConfirm = async () => {
  const newState = applyMove(gameState, selectedCell);
  if (gameMode === 'url') {
    const url = await generateURL(newState); // After move applied
    setShareUrl(url);
  }
};
```

### ‚ùå Collecting Both Names Upfront

**Wrong:** Player 1 name ‚Üí Player 2 name ‚Üí Mode selection ‚Üí PreGame

**Correct:** Player 1 name ‚Üí Mode selection ‚Üí PreGame ‚Üí Play ‚Üí P2 name on first handoff

### ‚ùå Different Flows for Each Mode

**Wrong:** Separate state machines for hot-seat vs URL

**Correct:** Single unified flow with UI variations

### ‚ùå Wrong localStorage Keys

**Hot-Seat:** Both players use separate keys (`player1-name`, `player2-name`)
**URL:** Each player uses `my-name` (same person across games)

## Testing Checklist

### Both Modes - Core Flow

- [ ] Enter name ‚Üí continues to mode selection
- [ ] Pre-filled name from localStorage works
- [ ] Can edit pre-filled name
- [ ] Choose mode ‚Üí goes to pre-game
- [ ] Pre-game shows correct info
- [ ] Start game ‚Üí board appears
- [ ] Can select a cell
- [ ] Selected cell is highlighted
- [ ] Can change selection by clicking different cell
- [ ] Can deselect by clicking same cell
- [ ] Confirm button appears when cell selected
- [ ] Confirm button text matches mode
- [ ] Move applies after confirm
- [ ] P2 name prompt appears on first handoff
- [ ] Can continue game after P2 enters name
- [ ] Win condition detected correctly
- [ ] Draw condition detected correctly
- [ ] Game over shows correct result
- [ ] Play Again returns to pre-game
- [ ] Main Menu resets everything

### Hot-Seat Mode Specific

- [ ] No warnings shown
- [ ] Handoff shows "Pass to Player 2" message
- [ ] "I'm Ready" button works
- [ ] Alternates between players correctly
- [ ] Both player names persist in localStorage

### URL Mode Specific

- [ ] Warning shown in pre-game
- [ ] Warning shown in P2 name prompt
- [ ] No URL generated until move confirmed
- [ ] URL generated after confirm

## Visual Design Notes

### Move Selection Highlight

Recommended styling:
```css
.cell.selected {
  border: 3px solid var(--cg-color-primary);
  background: var(--cg-color-cell-hover);
  box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 123, 255, 0.3);
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  .cell.selected {
    border-color: var(--cg-color-primary-dark);
    background: var(--cg-color-cell-hover-dark);
    box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(74, 158, 255, 0.5);
  }
}
```

### Confirm Button

Should be prominent:
```css
.confirm-button {
  display: block;
  margin: 20px auto;
  padding: 15px 30px;
  font-size: 18px;
  /* Use framework button classes */
}
```

---

## Example Implementation

See these games for reference:
- **Tic-Tac-Toe:** `games/tic-tac-toe/src/App.tsx` (being updated to this pattern)
- **Emoji Chain:** `games/emoji-chain/src/App.tsx` (being updated to this pattern)

---

## Migration Guide

If updating an existing game with separate flows:

1. **Identify shared states** - Most states are probably already the same
2. **Extract UI differences** - Note where modes differ
3. **Consolidate logic** - Use `gameMode` checks for UI only
4. **Update state diagram** - Use unified template
5. **Test both modes** - Ensure nothing broke
6. **Update documentation** - Sync STATE_DIAGRAMS.md

---

## Template Checklist

When creating/updating state diagrams:

- [ ] Used unified flow diagram (not separate)
- [ ] Documented all states with conditions
- [ ] Noted UI differences for each state
- [ ] Included move selection/confirmation states
- [ ] P2 name collected on first handoff
- [ ] Listed React state variables
- [ ] Listed game state structure
- [ ] Listed localStorage keys
- [ ] Documented mode-specific UI elements
- [ ] Created testing checklist
- [ ] Verified diagram matches code
